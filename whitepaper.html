      <h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Cryptopapies is a project made up of <strong>7777</strong> pixelated
        <strong>&quot;CryptoPapies&quot;</strong>, based on some of the most
        famous crypto and financial gurus out there. A crypto papi is a figure
        representing a crypto/financial guru who sells products and courses to
        help &quot;normal&quot; people become rich as they are and who also has
        a lot of attractiveness, a kind of appeal to their audience.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project&#39;s mission is to praise the rich man mindset, who should
        not feel ashamed for making money on others&#39; beliefs. Being rich is
        not a matter of money, but of mindset. Cryptopapies will become a status
        symbol for people embracing the rich man mindset.

      <h2 id="2-the-developer">2. The Developer</h2>
      <p>
        Cryptopapies is being developed by a one-man team, made up of Christian
        Visintin, a Software Engineer, born in Trieste on May 30, 1997. Since he
        was 14, he was really engaged in programming and in 2017 he got a job as
        a software developer. Since then, he&#39;s really been curious about new
        technology and in 2022, he decided to approach blockchains and web3 and,
        so decided to start the cryptopapies project. At the beginning, it was
        just a joke between friends, but finally he decided to give it a try.
      </p>
      <p>His favourite programming languages are Rust, Elixir and Python.</p>
      <p>
        More information regarding the developer can be found on its website

        <li>
          Once the first collection is sold, we&#39;ll arrange to create the
          first drop of the &quot;Signature Collection&quot; in partnership with
          a popular influencer in finance.
        </li>
        <li>The second collection is dropped</li>
        <li>
          Once 3333 NFTs are sold, CryptoPapies will donate 25% of their profits
          to support the most deserving independent open-source projects.

      <h2 id="4-nfts">4. NFTs</h2>
      <p>
        As stated in chapter 1, the NFT collection is made up of
        <strong>7777</strong> unique CryptoPapies, which can be divided into two
        categories:
      </p>
      <h3 id="4-1-auto-generated-nfts">4.1 auto-generated NFTs</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>7000</strong> of the total supply will be autogenerated by a
        Rust proprietary application, according to the NFT attributes. They will
        be totally random and unique.
        <strong
          >This means there cannot be two or more cryptopapies with the same
          attributes</strong
        >.
      </p>
      <p>The following attributes are available for this category:</p>
      <p>TBD</p>
      <h4 id="4-1-1-auto-generated-nfts-collections">
        4.1.1 auto-generated NFTs collections
      </h4>
      <p>
        All the auto-generated cryptopapies will be divided into collections
        with different charateristics:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The <strong>Dubai Papi Collection</strong> will be the first drop,
          with 1500 unique NFTs in the collection, representing papies making
          money in Dubai and flexing their fancy houses and luxury cars in the
          Arabic city.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <strong>Cryptoguru Collection</strong> will be the second one,
          with 1500 unique NFTs, representing influencers making money with
          crypto trading and giving advice on Twitter.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <strong>Wall Street Prodige Collection</strong>, with 500 unique
          NFTs, will be an old school collection of brokers in the 80&#39;s
          making money with stock trading in Wall St.
        </li>
        <li>TBD (1500)</li>
        <li>TBD (500)</li>
        <li>TBD (500)</li>
        <li>TBD 1000</li>
      </ol>
      <h3 id="4-2-signed-nfts">4.2 Signed NFTs</h3>
      <p>
        The remaining <strong>777</strong> NFTs are reserved for the
        <strong>Signature collection</strong>. The signature collection
        won&#39;t include any auto-generated NFTs, instead, they will be hand
        painted, by an artist in collaboration with a financial guru, who will
        be involved in a partnership with the project. Expect NFTs which belong
        to this collection to be released later, when the project will have
        reached a certain amount of people out there.
      </p>
      <h3 id="4-3-rarity">4.3 Rarity</h3>
      <p>
        Exception made for the &quot;Signature Collection&quot;, there won&#39;t
        be any rarity associated to the auto-generated NFT, since in
        CryptoPapies we believe each NFT we supply, must be beautiful as the
        other. So no, we&#39;re not going to make scrap art.
